Replace operator is an additionnal operator, like |c|, |d| or |p|. It operates
on a range of text, and accepts a register as input. Basically, it replaces
the text in {motion} or {Visual} with the content of register [x], or 
'clipboard' if none provided.

The deleted text is sent to black hole register by default. You can set the
default register by setting:

    let g:replace_register = '_'

When g:replace_register is set to '|', the text is exchanged between 
the two register.
